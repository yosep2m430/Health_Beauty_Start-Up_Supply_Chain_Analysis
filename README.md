*Through a widespread use of social media, health and beauty have been continuously growing business. Our goal is to develop a data-driven recommendation to optimize the business by improving revenue and minimizing risks.* 

## 1.Data
A CSV file containing product data, associated costs, revenues, and routes data was obtained from Kaggle:<br>

## 2.Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Modeling
[Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).ipynb](https://github.com/yosep2m430/Song-Recommendation-System-Capstone-3-/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20(EDA).ipynb)<br>
In Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the relationships between product supply features and revenues and customers are explored. More specifically, the data was used for quality control, inventory optimzation, and risk score calculation. A product with high risk score, high Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), and low revenue was identified to create recommendation for potential revenue improvement. Regression model and tensor flow was used to predict costs with mean absolute error of 27.97%<br>

## 3.Future Improvements
I would love to work with temporal data if it is available somewhere. More specifically, I would love to use it to analyze seasonality, to forecast demands.
